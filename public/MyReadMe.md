##Goal
- Create a submit feature that sends input to array on server.js and adds new object
- Will not allow duplicate info added to object
  1. if duplicate info is sent tells user in alert 'You are not original'
  2. alert only fires if 418 statusCode is sent from server.js
- on load adds array info from server as a list to the DOM
- Have a dynamic remove button that removes li that button is nested in from the html

#Things to improve

- its ugly improve that
- add an ajax that will update the array on the server.js when the list is deleted
